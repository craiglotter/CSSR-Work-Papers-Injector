Twenty years of the sub-Saharan HIV/AIDS epidemic has impressed upon us the extent to which 
this disease is far more than a public health challenge. As it ravishes fragile economics, decreases life 
expectancies, increases women’s burdens, generates orphans and decimates the dreams and futures of 
millions of people, HIV/AIDS has become nothing less than the most ominous development challenge 
facing the African continent. Contemplation of the sheer magnitude of the social repercussions 
brought in the wake of HIV/AIDS incurs the risk of crippling our senses and blocking the imagination 
needed for addressing this crisis. Indeed, the personal impact is sharpened rather than mitigated by 
the realization that this disease is, after all, almost entirely preventable. The poignancy of this simple 
but painful truth was clearly articulated in 1991 when President Museveni of Uganda declared to his 
parliament: ‘They are telling us that a thin piece of rubber stands between us and the future of our 
continent!’ (Museveni 1997). Still today, more than a decade after the time of that statement, many 
hopes for Africa are vested in that thin piece of rubber. Primary prevention through behaviour change 
involving safer-sex practices is still the most viable and potentially effective option for halting the 
spread of HIV/AIDS in these resource poor countries where affordable treatment is lacking (Davis 
and Weller, 1999; Donovan and Ross, 2000; Pequegnat and Stover, 2000).<br />&nbsp;<br />
This paper focuses on the socio-cultural context in which the enactment of ‘highrisk’ youth sexual 
activity takes place. It is divided into two parts: the first examines the general body of research on 
HIV/AIDS and youth, with particular reference to South Africa; the second discusses some recent 
findings from ongoing ethnographic research at St Wendolin’s, a peri-urban Zulu-speaking community 
in Durban, on aspects of sexual culture that enhance the spread of HIV/AIDS. Currently it is 
estimated that between 30-40% of the adult population of KwaZulu-Natal is HIV infected (Whiteside 
and Sunter 2000). As a whole, African communities in the greater metropolitan Durban area, and 
indeed throughout KwaZulu-Natal province, represent high seroprevalence epicentres for HIV/AIDS. <br />&nbsp;<br />
