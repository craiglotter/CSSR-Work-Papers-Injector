<div align="justify">
This paper develops indices to measure HIV/AIDS stigma and explores potential determinants of this stigma. Indices are designed to measure the different dimensions of HIV/AIDS stigma. Findings show that levels of stigma vary depending on the measure of stigma used. Furthermore, despite stigma not being expressed consistently in each stigma index, the majority of respondents do exhibit HIV/AIDS stigma in some form. Judgemental attitudes and fear of infection are expressed with greater prevalence than intentions to discriminate against people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The respondents' understanding of HIV transmission is found to have the greatest impact on predicting levels of HIV/AIDS stigma, providing evidence for the importance of education campaigns. Racial differences are also salient in predicting both the magnitude of HIV/AIDS stigma and its determinants. This suggests that cultural and environmental aspects need to be considered when addressing HIV/AIDS stigma.
