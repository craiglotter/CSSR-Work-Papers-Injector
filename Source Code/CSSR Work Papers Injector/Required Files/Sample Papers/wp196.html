<b>Abstract</b><br />&nbsp;<br />
HIV prevalence is high among South African youth. Health behavior models<br>
posit that perceived risk of HIV/AIDS is associated with HIV/AIDS risk<br>
behaviors, but research in sub-Saharan Africa that has considered the<br>
predictors of HIV/AIDS risk perceptions and behaviors or the relationship<br>
between them has been limited. Longitudinal data collected in 2002 and 2005<br>
from 3,025 black, coloured, and white youth aged 14-22 (in 2002) in Cape<br>
Town, South Africa were analyzed using multivariate regression to examine<br>
correlates of perceived HIV/AIDS risk and one HIV/AIDS risk behavior,<br>
transition to first sex. Independent variables taken from the 2002 survey were<br>
used to predict dependent variables taken from the 2005 survey. Results indicate<br>
that most respondents viewed themselves at no risk or small risk of HIV<br>
infection. Perceived risk of HIV/AIDS was positively associated with having had<br>
sex and knowing somebody with HIV/AIDS. Among those who were virgins in<br>
2002, perceived HIV/AIDS risk and knowing somebody with HIV/AIDS<br>
predicted entry into first sex by 2005 for females only. The effects of race on 
risk<br>
perceptions also varied by gender. In conclusion, HIV/AIDS education and<br>
prevention programs should consider more carefully how gender and race may<br>
intersect to influence risk perceptions and risk behaviors. The reciprocal<br>
relationship between risk perceptions and risk behaviors should also be<br>
considered in education and intervention programs.&nbsp;<br />
