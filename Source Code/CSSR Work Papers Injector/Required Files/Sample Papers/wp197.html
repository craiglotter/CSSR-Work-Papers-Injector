<b>Abstract</b><br />&nbsp;<br />
HIV literacy has been emphasised as part of HIV/AIDS campaigns throughout<br>
the world. The South African Government&#8217;s allocation of past and present<br>
funding indicates substantial support for HIV/AIDS education with the emphasis<br>
on prevention. Commitment to the new HIV and AIDS and STI National<br>
Strategic Plan 2007-2011 for addressing the epidemic emphasises the<br>
importance of speeding up the delivery of HAART in South. The link between<br>
education and the provision of antiretroviral therapy lies in the need for 
patients<br>
to understand the nature of the HI virus and the way the medication works<br>
physiologically in order to ensure adherence, control side effects and provide<br>
the best care possible for people living with HIV/AIDS. This paper assesses the<br>
role of HIV literacy from the perspective of community health workers working<br>
in clinics in the Western Cape Province in South Africa. It looks at their daily<br>
interaction with clinic patients, as well as their experience of the HAART 
rollout.<br>
It aims to evaluate the impact of HIV literacy on the communities they work<br>
in and the limitations of education in supporting the provision of health care 
for<br>
people living with HIV/AIDS.&nbsp;<br />
