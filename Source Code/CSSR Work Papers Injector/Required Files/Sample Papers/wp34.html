<div align="justify">From Botswana to Zimbabwe, the present state of democratic politics across southern Africa leaves much to be desired. Yet as imperfect as it may be, few people would wish to go back in time. Too many people remember what life was like under the former colonial, settler, one party or military 
regimes that this region endured. But the persistence of democracy, as imperfect as it may be, cannot 
be taken for granted. While HIV/AIDS kills people, damages households, and strains national 
economies, there are many reasons to believe it may also threaten the existence of democratic 
government. The purpose of this paper is to sketch out the potential challenges that the HIV/AIDS 
pandemic may pose to southern Africa's young and fragile democracies, assess the state of our 
knowledge about that threat, and identify priority areas for future research: that is, those areas where 
the potential threat to democracy is greatest but where our knowledge is least.
