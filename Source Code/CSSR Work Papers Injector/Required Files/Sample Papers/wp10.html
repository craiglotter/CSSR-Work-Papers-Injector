Education is the largest area of expenditure in the South African state budget. In the 2001/02 financial 
year, nearly R60 billion, or 22% of the total budget, was notionally allocated to education. The bulk 
of this budget – R44 billion in 2001/02 – is transferred to the nine provincial education departments 
for primary and secondary schooling. In comparison with other middleincome countries, the 
government’s expenditure on education, relative to both the total government budget and the GDP, is 
high.<br />&nbsp;<br />
Yet the quality of schooling in South Africa is believed to be relatively poor. Pass rates in the 
matriculation examination are low, and studies comparing literacy and numeracy among students in 
different countries almost routinely put South Africa at the bottom of the list. The important 1999 
study, Getting Learning Right (Taylor and Vinjevold, 1999), painted a sorry picture of the state of 
South African schooling. The national Department of Education itself, in its own documentation, 
acknowledges the many weaknesses of the schooling system (see, for example, Department of 
Education, 2000a).  <br />&nbsp;<br />
