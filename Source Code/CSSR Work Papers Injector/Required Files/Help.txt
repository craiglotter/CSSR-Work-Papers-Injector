CSSR Work Papers Injector

I recently took over the CSSR website for Commerce IT. The site is poorly designed and is made up of a number of flat html files. Given the mandate to update the site, one of the things I decided to do was create an ASP based management module for their working papers. In order to do this, I need the information contained in the flat files to be put in a useable Access database. CSSR Work Papers Injector is the tool for this job, parsing the existing files and injecting the information into a specified database. 

To run this pretty much once-off application, simply select a folder containing valid working paper HTML files (samples included in the installation folder) as well as the CSSR database in which to insert the data into (again, sample database is included in the installation folder).

To start the operation, simply click on the Begin button. 

The help and about menu options brings up the help and about dialog boxes respectively.
