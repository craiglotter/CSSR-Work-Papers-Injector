CSSR Work Papers Injector

I recently took over the CSSR website for Commerce IT. The site is poorly designed and is made up of a number of flat html files. Given the mandate to update the site, one of the things I decided to do was create an ASP based management module for their working papers. In order to do this, I need the information contained in the flat files to be put in a useable Access database. CSSR Work Papers Injector is the tool for this job, parsing the existing files and injecting the information into a specified database. 

Note: The sample files and database are included in the installation folder.
